Theming the volume plugin:

  Using the "volume" plugin keyword you can theme like you would all the other
  meters (see the theme documentation).  The slider krells have the same
  behaviour as 'normal krells'

  Using "volume.level_slider" or "volume.balance_slider", you can theme the 
  krells of the level and balance seperately
